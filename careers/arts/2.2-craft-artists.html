            <li><strong>Specialization:</strong> Developing a unique style or specializing in a highly sought-after craft can help artists stand out.</li>
            <li><strong>Teaching and Workshops:</strong> Many craft artists supplement their income by teaching classes or workshops, sharing their skills with others.</li>
            <li><strong>Commissions:</strong> Creating custom pieces for clients can be a significant source of income.</li>
        </ul>
