        <h1>Probation Officers and Correctional Treatment Specialists</h1>
        <p>Probation officers and correctional treatment specialists work within the criminal justice system to supervise and rehabilitate offenders. Their primary goal is to reduce recidivism by helping individuals reintegrate into society, adhere to legal requirements, and address underlying issues that contribute to criminal behavior. While both roles focus on rehabilitation, probation officers primarily work with offenders in the community, while correctional treatment specialists work within correctional facilities.</p>

        <h2>Job Description</h2>
