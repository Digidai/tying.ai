            <p>The work of a computer programmer is highly logical and detail-oriented, requiring precision and problem-solving skills. Their duties typically include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Writing Code:</strong> Translating software designs and specifications into programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, C#).</li>
                <li><strong>Testing and Debugging:</strong> Identifying and correcting errors (bugs) in existing code or newly written programs to ensure they function correctly and efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance and Updates:</strong> Modifying existing software to fix errors, improve performance, or adapt it to new hardware or operating environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Writing clear and concise documentation for the code, including comments within the code itself, and external technical specifications for other developers.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Working closely with software developers, engineers, and other team members to understand requirements and integrate different parts of a system.</li>
                <li><strong>System Analysis:</strong> Analyzing user needs and software requirements to determine the feasibility of design within time and cost constraints.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Implementing secure coding practices to protect software from vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Programmers work in nearly every industry, including technology companies, financial institutions, healthcare, government, and manufacturing. They may specialize in areas like web development, mobile app development, game development, or embedded systems.</p>
