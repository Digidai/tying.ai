        <section class="container" style="padding: var(--spacing-xxl) 0;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 3.5rem; margin-bottom: var(--spacing-md);">US Recruitment Market Analysis Report (2024-2025)</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: var(--text-secondary); max-width: 800px;">This report provides an in-depth analysis of the US recruitment market for 2024-2025, covering key trends, challenges, and opportunities. The US job market demonstrates significant resilience despite inflationary pressures and a high-interest-rate environment. Year-to-date in 2024, the overall job market performance has exceeded expectations, with average monthly job growth remaining above 200,000 and the unemployment rate stable around 4%.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: var(--text-secondary); max-width: 800px;">However, the job market is undergoing structural changes, with notable performance differences across various industries and demographic groups. The service sector continues to expand, while manufacturing faces contraction; demand for high-skilled positions is strong, while some traditional roles face challenges from AI and automation. Looking ahead to 2025, as the Federal Reserve may begin to cut interest rates, the job market is expected to maintain stable growth, though the pace may slow, with projected average monthly job growth in the 100,000-150,000 range.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-xl);">
                <iframe src="us-recruitment-market/data_visualization/macro_trend.html" height="500" width="100%" title="US Job Market Macro Trend Forecast" style="border: none;"></iframe>
                <p style="text-align: center; color: var(--text-secondary); margin-top: var(--spacing-sm);"><em>Figure 1: US Job Market Macro Trend Forecast</em></p>
            </div>
            <p>Since 2023, the US economy has shown greater-than-expected resilience, with the job market remaining strong. The unemployment rate has fluctuated around 4.0%, below the historical average, indicating a still-tight labor market. Nonfarm payrolls, while volatile, have generally remained at a healthy level. In May 2024, 272,000 jobs were added, and in December, 256,000, showing continued robust job growth momentum. Wage growth has remained around 4%, slightly above the inflation rate, indicating an improvement in workers' real purchasing power. The labor force participation rate has remained stable at 62.5%, below pre-pandemic levels, reflecting that some workers have not yet returned to the job market, which is one reason for the tight labor market.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Unemployment rate and new job figures show a complementary relationship. From the beginning of 2024 to date, as new job creation has remained at a healthy level, the unemployment rate has gradually stabilized around 4%. It is projected that in 2025, as economic growth may slow, the unemployment rate might slightly increase to the 4.2-4.5% range, but still remain at a historically low level. Notably, the proportion of long-term unemployed has decreased, while the ratio of temporary layoffs has risen, indicating more flexible adjustments in the job market.</p>

            <h3>High-Growth Industries</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Grew 6.8% in 2024, projected to grow 7.2% in 2025, driven by an aging population and increased medical demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Government:</strong> Grew 4.3% in 2024, including federal, state, and local government positions, driven by service demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Leisure & Hospitality:</strong> Grew 4.2% in 2024, driven by tourism recovery and increased service demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology Sector:</strong> Despite structural adjustments, demand for talent in sub-sectors like AI, data science, and cybersecurity remains strong.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Industries Facing Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Declined 0.5% in 2024, projected to decline 0.8% in 2025, facing pressure from automation and global competition.</li>
                <li><strong>Mining:</strong> Declined 2.1% in 2024, employment shrinking due to energy transition and market volatility.</li>
                <li><strong>Retail Trade:</strong> Physical retail faces e-commerce impact, with continued loss of traditional retail jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Services:</strong> Reduction in traditional banking roles, digital transformation leading to some job disappearance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The US job market is accelerating its transition from manufacturing to services. The service sector (healthcare/education/government/professional services) added approximately 1.67 million jobs in 2024, while manufacturing is expected to lose 264,000 jobs. Wage disparities are also becoming more pronounced: technology-intensive industries offer significant wage premiums, e.g., median salary for business analysts is $95,290, and for computer managers $164,070, far exceeding traditional industries. This structural transformation has significant implications for the labor market, requiring workers to continuously develop skills to adapt to changing job environments.</p>

            <h3>AI and Automation's Dual Effect</h3>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence and Automation technologies are reshaping the job market, with an expected impact on 78 million jobs by 2030. The impact is twofold: it replaces some traditional jobs while creating new ones. AI's impact is most pronounced in entry-level positions, especially in areas like data processing, customer service, and administrative support. Skill premium phenomenon is becoming more evident, with AI and digital skills commanding higher wages than average in the industry.</p>
            <h3>Digital Transformation Changes Recruitment Process</h3>
            <p>Digital acceleration in recruitment processes, with social media recruitment, AI-assisted screening, and remote interviews becoming mainstream. These changes have improved recruitment efficiency but also require job seekers to adapt to digital recruitment environments.</p>
            <h3>Remote Work Trend Continues</h3>
            <p>Remote work mode has been retained post-pandemic, with hybrid work becoming the new norm. This expands the geographical scope of the talent market but also intensifies competition for certain positions.</p>
            <h3>Rapid Skill Demand Changes</h3>
            <p>Technological progress leads to rapid skill demand changes, with the "half-life" shortening. Continuous learning and skill updating have become essential for career development.</p>

            <h3>Education Background Differences</h3>
            <p>Average unemployment rate for college graduates (22-27 years old) is 3.6%, significantly lower than the national average, but 39.5% of them are underemployed, indicating that many young graduates are working in jobs that do not match their educational background. Professional choice has a significant impact on employment prospects: the unemployment rate for history major is as high as 8%, while the underemployment rate for aerospace engineering is only 17.9%. In terms of international student employment competitiveness, San Jose State University ranks first, indicating that the school has a relatively effective support for international students' employment.</p>

Skill level differences are obvious: high-skilled labor accounts for 55% in exports and only 43% in imports, indicating that the US has a comparative advantage in high-skilled fields. These differences indicate that improving educational level and professional skills are crucial for improving employment prospects.</p>

            <h3>Special Groups and Long-Term Unemployment</h3>
            <p>Immigrants and international students face different challenges in the job market: the unemployment rate for immigrants is about 11%, significantly higher than domestic residents, reflecting their employment barriers; while the international student employment market has improved, the unemployment rate has dropped to 4%, but new immigrants still face high employment friction. Long-term unemployment issues still exist: 6.9 million unemployed in December 2024, temporary layoffs accounting for 70% of the increase in the number of unemployed, indicating more flexible adjustments in the job market. Notably, the proportion of unemployed receiving unemployment benefits has dropped to 25%, reflecting the challenges of social security network coverage. These data reveal the structural inequality in the job market, requiring targeted policy interventions.</p>
