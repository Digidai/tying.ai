      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Despite differing by just one letter, "AI Agent" and "Agentic AI" represent fundamentally
        different architectural paradigms in artificial intelligence systems. Understanding this distinction
        is crucial for practitioners implementing production AI solutions.
      </p>

      <!-- What is an AI Agent -->
