        <h1>Environmental Engineering Technologists and Technicians</h1>
        <p>Environmental engineering technologists and technicians play a crucial role in protecting the environment by assisting environmental engineers in developing and implementing solutions to environmental problems. This career path involves a combination of fieldwork, laboratory analysis, and office-based tasks.</p>

        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Environmental engineering technologists and technicians are responsible for a wide range of duties, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operating and Maintaining Equipment:</strong> They set up, test, operate, and modify equipment used to prevent and clean up environmental pollution.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Collection and Analysis:</strong> A key part of their job is collecting and analyzing samples of air, water, and soil to monitor pollution levels. They also record and document test results, often using specialized software.</li>
            <li><strong>Field and Laboratory Work:</strong> Their work takes them to various settings. In the field, they may conduct pollution surveys and inspect facilities for compliance with environmental regulations. In the laboratory, they perform tests on samples and maintain equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Support:</strong> They assist environmental engineers by maintaining project records, preparing reports, and ensuring that documents are complete and conform to requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Essential Skills</h2>
        <p>To succeed in this field, individuals need a combination of technical and soft skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> A strong understanding of scientific principles and methods is essential. They must be proficient in quality control analysis and able to operate and troubleshoot complex equipment. Familiarity with analytical or scientific software, such as The MathWorks MATLAB, is also valuable.</li>
            <li><strong>Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving:</strong> They need to identify problems, analyze data, and help implement solutions designed by engineers.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication and Teamwork:</strong> Strong communication skills are necessary for working effectively in a team and conveying information to supervisors and colleagues.</li>
            <li><strong>Observational Skills:</strong> The ability to carefully observe and document environmental conditions and test results is crucial.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Career Outlook</h2>
        <p>The career outlook for environmental engineering technologists and technicians shows slower than average growth. However, there are still expected to be around 1,200 job openings each year, primarily due to the need to replace workers who are retiring or moving to other occupations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Salary:</strong> The median annual wage for environmental engineering technologists and technicians was $58,890 in May 2024. Salaries can range from less than $39,670 to more than $92,280.</li>
            <li><strong>Job Growth:</strong> Employment in this field is projected to grow 2 percent from 2023 to 2033.</li>
            <li><strong>Education and Advancement:</strong> An associate's degree in environmental engineering technology or a related field is typically required. With experience, technicians can advance to senior or lead technician roles, and those with a bachelor's degree may become environmental engineers.</li>
        </ul>
