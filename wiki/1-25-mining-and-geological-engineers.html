      <h3>Typical Daily Tasks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core:</strong> Design open-pit and underground mines, conduct geological surveys, plan extraction processes</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> Work with geologists, environmental scientists, and mine workers</li>
        <li><strong>Supportive:</strong> Ensure safety regulations are met, manage projects, prepare technical reports</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tools &amp; Tech Stack</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Machines:</strong> Heavy mining equipment (knowledge of), surveying tools (GPS, total stations)</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> Mine planning software (Surpac, Vulcan, MineSight), geological modeling software, CAD</li>
        <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Not typically required, but scripting can be useful for data analysis</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Common Specializations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mining Engineer (focus on extraction)</li>
        <li>Geological Engineer (focus on earth science applications)</li>
        <li>Mineral Processing Engineer</li>
        <li>Mining Safety Engineer</li>
      </ul>
