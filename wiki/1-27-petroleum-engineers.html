      <h2>1. What They Do</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Petroleum Engineers design and develop methods for extracting oil and gas from deposits below the Earth's surface. They also find new ways to extract oil and gas from older wells.</p>
      <h3>Typical Daily Tasks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core:</strong> Analyze geological data, design drilling plans, monitor production operations</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> Work with geoscientists, drilling contractors, and production crews</li>
        <li><strong>Supportive:</strong> Conduct economic analysis of reservoirs, ensure environmental and safety compliance</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tools &amp; Tech Stack</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Machines:</strong> Drilling rigs, pumping systems (knowledge of)</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> Reservoir simulation software (Eclipse, CMG), drilling simulation software, well logging analysis tools (Petrel)</li>
        <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Python, MATLAB for data analysis and modeling</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Common Specializations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reservoir Engineers:</strong> Estimate the amount of oil and gas in a reservoir and develop strategies to maximize recovery.</li>
        <li><strong>Drilling Engineers:</strong> Plan and manage the drilling operations to create wells.</li>
        <li><strong>Production Engineers:</strong> Monitor and optimize the performance of wells once they are completed.</li>
        <li><strong>Completions Engineers:</strong> Design and install the equipment needed to finish a well and start production.</li>
      </ul>
