      <h2>1. What They Do</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Surveying and Mapping Technicians collect data and make maps of the Earth's surface. Surveying technicians visit sites to take measurements of land features, while mapping technicians (including photogrammetrists and cartographers) use geographic data to create maps.</p>
      <h3>Typical Daily Tasks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Surveying Techs:</strong> Operate surveying instruments (total stations, GPS), set up control points, record field notes, and take measurements.</li>
        <li><strong>Mapping Techs:</strong> Use GIS and mapping software to create maps, analyze spatial data, and update geographic databases.</li>
        <li><strong>Both:</strong> Work under the supervision of surveyors, cartographers, or photogrammetrists.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tools &amp; Tech Stack</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Machines:</strong> Total stations, theodolites, GPS receivers, laser scanners, drones (UAVs).</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> GIS software (ArcGIS, QGIS), CAD software (AutoCAD Civil 3D), photogrammetry software (Pix4D).</li>
        <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Python scripting for GIS automation is a plus.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Common Specializations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Land Surveying Technician</li>
        <li>Geodetic Survey Technician</li>
        <li>GIS Technician</li>
        <li>Photogrammetry Technician</li>
        <li>Cartographic Technician</li>
      </ul>
