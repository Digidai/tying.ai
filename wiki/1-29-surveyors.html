        <li><strong>Supportive:</strong> Research historical records, manage survey crews, testify in court cases regarding their findings.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tools &amp; Tech Stack</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Machines:</strong> Total stations, GPS/GNSS receivers, laser scanners (LiDAR), drones.</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> CAD software (AutoCAD Civil 3D, Trimble Business Center), GIS, data processing software.</li>
        <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Not a primary skill, but some use scripting for data processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Common Specializations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Boundary Surveyor:</strong> Establishes legal property lines.</li>
        <li><strong>Construction Surveyor:</strong> Provides measurements for construction projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Geodetic Surveyor:</strong> Measures large areas of the Earth's surface with high precision.</li>
        <li><strong>Topographic Surveyor:</strong> Creates maps showing the features and elevation of a piece of land.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrographic Surveyor:</strong> Surveys bodies of water.</li>
      </ul>
