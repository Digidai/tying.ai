                <h2>Job Description</h2>
                <p>Set and exhibit designers are responsible for creating the physical environments for a wide range of productions and events. Set designers work in performance arts, like theater, film, and television, to create the scenery that helps tell the story. Exhibit designers work on displays for museums, galleries, trade shows, and other public events, aiming to inform and engage visitors. Both roles require a blend of artistic vision, practical construction knowledge, and the ability to work collaboratively to bring a concept to life.</p>

                <h2>Career Path</h2>
                <p>A bachelor's degree in theater design, fine arts, or a related field is typically required. A strong portfolio showcasing design work is essential for securing jobs. Many designers start their careers as assistants to established designers or by working on smaller, independent productions. As they build experience and a network of contacts, they can take on lead designer roles for larger and more prestigious projects. Success in this field often depends on reputation and networking within the entertainment or museum industries.</p>

                <h2>Market Trends</h2>
                <p>Technology is playing a larger role in set and exhibit design. Designers are increasingly using CAD, 3D modeling, and digital fabrication tools to create and visualize their designs. In exhibit design, there is a strong trend toward creating interactive and immersive experiences using multimedia and technology to engage audiences. In theater and film, the use of digital projections and virtual sets is becoming more common, requiring designers to have skills in both physical and digital design. The demand for designers is tied to the health of the arts, entertainment, and museum sectors.</p>
