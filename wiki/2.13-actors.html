                    <h2>Career Path</h2>
                    <p>There is no single path to becoming an actor. While some attend drama schools or universities to earn a degree in theater or acting, others find success through workshops and direct experience. Building a career involves constant auditioning, networking, and honing one's craft. Early work may be in smaller theater productions, independent films, or as extras. As actors build their resumes and reputation, they may get larger roles and hire agents to help them find work and negotiate contracts. Success is often dependent on talent, persistence, and a degree of luck.</p>

                    <h2>Market Trends</h2>
                    <p>The proliferation of content on streaming services has created a high demand for actors and a greater number of available roles. This has also led to more diverse casting opportunities. However, the field remains extremely competitive. Many actors supplement their income with other work. The rise of self-taped auditions has changed the casting process, allowing actors to audition for roles remotely.
