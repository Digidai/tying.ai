                <h2>Job Description</h2>
                <p>Dancers use their bodies as an instrument to perform, express ideas, and tell stories. They train rigorously to develop strength, flexibility, and technical skill in various dance styles, such as ballet, modern, jazz, tap, or hip-hop. Dancers may perform as part of a company, in musical theater, on television or in films, on cruise ships, or as backup dancers for musical artists. The career is physically demanding and requires a high level of dedication and discipline.</p>

            <section id="career-path">
                <h2>Career Path</h2>
                <p>Most dancers begin training at a very young age. While a degree in dance can be beneficial, technical skill and experience are more important. A dancer's career is built through auditions and performances. They may join a professional dance company, which provides some stability, or work on a freelance basis, moving from one show or contract to another. Because a dancer's performance career is often short due to the physical demands, many transition into roles as choreographers, dance teachers, or artistic directors later in their careers.</p>

                <h2>Market Trends</h2>
                <p>The field of dance is highly competitive, with more aspiring dancers than available full-time positions. However, opportunities exist in a wide range of venues. Versatility in multiple dance styles can increase a dancer's employability. Social media and video platforms have become important tools for dancers to showcase their talent and build a personal brand. There is a growing appreciation for dance as a form of fitness and recreation, creating teaching opportunities in studios and community centers.</p>
