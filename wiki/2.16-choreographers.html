                <h2>Job Description</h2>
                <p>Choreographers are the architects of dance. They create and arrange dance movements and sequences for all forms of performance, from ballet and modern dance concerts to Broadway musicals, opera, film, and music videos. They conceptualize the dance, teach the steps to dancers, and lead rehearsals to ensure the performance is polished and emotionally resonant. A choreographer's work involves interpreting music, themes, or scripts and translating them into physical expression.</p>

            <section id="career-path">
                <h2>Career Path</h2>
                <p>Nearly all choreographers begin their careers as dancers, gaining years of performance experience and a deep understanding of movement and technique. There is no formal certification, but a bachelor's or master's degree in dance can be valuable. Dancers often transition to choreography by first creating smaller pieces for workshops or local companies. Building a reputation and a portfolio of successful work is key to advancing. Successful choreographers may become artistic directors of dance companies or work on high-profile, large-scale productions.</p>

            <section id="market-trends">
                <h2>Market Trends</h2>
                <p>The demand for choreographers is connected to the health of the performing arts sector. While competition for jobs with major dance companies and theater productions is intense, there are opportunities in a variety of other areas, including college dance programs, community arts centers, and commercial work like music videos and advertising. Choreographers who are versatile and can work across different genres—from classical to contemporary to commercial—are often more successful. The ability to use digital tools to plan and visualize choreography is also becoming a useful skill.</p>
