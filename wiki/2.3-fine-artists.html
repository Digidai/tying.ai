                    <h2>Job Description</h2>
                    <p>Fine artists use their creative talents to produce works of art. Their work is often purely aesthetic and expressive, though it can also be functional or commercial.</p>
                    <h3>Painters</h3>
                    <p>Painters apply paint to surfaces like canvas, paper, or walls to create images and express ideas. They work with various media, including oil, watercolor, acrylic, and mixed media.</p>
                    <h3>Sculptors</h3>
                    <p>Sculptors design and create three-dimensional forms from materials such as clay, stone, metal, or wood. Their work can range from small figurines to large public installations.</p>
                    <h3>Illustrators</h3>
                    <p>Illustrators create pictures for books, magazines, advertisements, and other commercial products. They often work digitally and must be able to meet client specifications and deadlines.</p>

                    <h2>Career Path</h2>
                    <p>The career path for a fine artist is highly individualized. Most are self-employed and build their careers by developing a strong portfolio and gaining recognition for their unique style. They may exhibit their work in galleries, museums, and at art shows. Many artists supplement their income by teaching, giving workshops, taking on commercial projects, or working in related fields like graphic design or art restoration.

                    <h2>Market Trends</h2>
                    <p>The market for fine art can be unpredictable and is often tied to economic conditions. While the traditional gallery system remains important, the internet and social media have become vital tools for artists to market themselves and sell their work directly to collectors. Digital art and illustration are growing fields, with increasing opportunities in media and entertainment. Competition is intense, as there are typically more qualified artists than available opportunities.</p>
