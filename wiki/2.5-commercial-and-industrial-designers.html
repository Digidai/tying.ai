Graduates often begin as junior designers, working as part of a larger design team. With experience, they can progress to senior designer or design lead roles, taking on more responsibility for projects.

                <h2>Market Trends</h2>
                <p>The field of industrial design is increasingly focused on user experience (UX) and sustainability. Designers who can create intuitive, user-centered products are in high demand. There's also a strong trend towards designing for the circular economy, creating products that are durable, repairable, and recyclable. Technology, particularly 3D printing and advanced CAD software, continues to revolutionize the design process, allowing for rapid prototyping and more complex forms. As manufacturing becomes more globalized, designers need a good understanding of international markets and production methods.</p>
