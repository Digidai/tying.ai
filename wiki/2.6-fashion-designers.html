                    <h2>Job Description</h2>
                    <p>Fashion designers are the visionaries behind clothing, accessories, and footwear. They create designs, select materials, and oversee the entire process of bringing a garment from concept to retail. Designers can specialize in different areas, such as high fashion (haute couture), everyday wear (ready-to-wear), sportswear, or accessories. The role demands immense creativity, a keen eye for trends, and a deep understanding of the production process.</p>

                    <h2>Career Path</h2>
                    <p>Most fashion designers have a bachelor's degree in fashion design or a related field. The career often begins with an internship or an entry-level position as a design assistant. Aspiring designers build their portfolio and gain experience in the industry. With a proven track record, they can advance to become lead designers. Many successful designers eventually start their own fashion labels, which requires not only design talent but also strong business and marketing skills. The fashion industry is centered in major cities like New York, Paris, Milan, and London, so relocation is common.</p>

                <section id="market-trends">
                    <h2>Market Trends</h2>
                    <p>The fashion industry is rapidly changing, influenced by technology and shifting consumer values. Sustainability and ethical production are major trends, with a growing demand for eco-friendly materials and transparent supply chains. "Fast fashion" is facing backlash, creating opportunities for designers focused on quality and longevity. E-commerce and social media have transformed how fashion is marketed and sold, allowing independent designers to build direct relationships with customers. Digital design and 3D prototyping are also becoming more prevalent, streamlining the design-to-production workflow.</p>
