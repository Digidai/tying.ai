                <h2>Career Path</h2>
                <p>A career in graphic design typically requires a bachelor's degree in the field and a strong portfolio of work. Entry-level designers often work in-house at companies or for design agencies. With experience, they can advance to senior designer or art director roles, leading creative projects and managing teams. Many graphic designers also work as freelancers, building their own client base. Specializations in areas like user interface (UI), user experience (UX), or motion graphics are becoming increasingly important for career advancement.</p>

            <section id="market-trends">
                <h2>Market Trends</h2>
                <p>The demand for graphic designers is steady, but the nature of the work is evolving. While traditional print design is less prevalent, the need for digital design for websites, mobile apps, and social media is growing rapidly. Expertise in UI/UX design is particularly valuable as companies focus on creating seamless digital experiences for their users. The ability to work with motion graphics and video is also a significant advantage. The field is competitive, so designers must continually learn new software and adapt to changing visual trends.</p>
