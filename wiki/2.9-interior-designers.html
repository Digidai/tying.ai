They work on a variety of projects, from residential homes to large commercial buildings like offices, hotels, and hospitals.

                    <h2>Career Path</h2>
                    <p>A bachelor's degree in interior design is the typical entry point for this profession. Many states also require designers to pass a licensing exam, such as the NCIDQ (National Council for Interior Design Qualification). Early career designers often work at architecture or design firms to gain experience. With a strong portfolio and experience, they can advance to senior designer or project manager roles. Many eventually open their own design firms. Specializing in areas like sustainable (green) design, healthcare, or hospitality design can open up further career opportunities.</p>

                    <h2>Market Trends</h2>
                    <p>Sustainable design is a major trend, with clients increasingly requesting the use of environmentally friendly materials and energy-efficient solutions. Technology is also impacting the field, with designers using 3D modeling and virtual reality (VR) to help clients visualize spaces before construction begins. There is a growing focus on designing spaces that promote well-being and productivity, such as in office and healthcare environments. While competition is strong, designers with specialized knowledge and strong technical skills are well-positioned for success.</p>
