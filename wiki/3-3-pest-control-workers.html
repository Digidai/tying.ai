        <h2>Career Outlook</h2>
        <p>The career outlook for pest control workers is generally stable, driven by the continuous need for pest management services in both residential and commercial sectors. Factors such as urbanization, climate change, and increased awareness of health and property risks associated with pests contribute to ongoing demand.</p>
        <p>Key factors influencing the outlook include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Health Concerns:</strong> The role of pest control in preventing disease transmission and maintaining hygiene.</li>
            <li><strong>Property Protection:</strong> Protecting homes and businesses from structural damage caused by pests.</li>

            <li><strong>Environmental Regulations:</strong> Growing emphasis on environmentally friendly and integrated pest management (IPM) approaches, requiring workers to stay updated on best practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> Use of new technologies like thermal imaging, remote monitoring, and more targeted application methods.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most pest control workers receive on-the-job training, but many states require licensing and certification, which involves passing exams on pest biology, safe pesticide handling, and relevant regulations. Continuous education is often required to maintain licenses. Experience can lead to supervisory roles, specialization (e.g., termite control), or starting one's own pest control business.</p>
