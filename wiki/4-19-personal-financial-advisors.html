            <h2>How to become a Personal Financial Advisor?</h2>
            <p>A bachelor's degree in finance, economics, accounting, or a related field is the standard entry requirement. Professional certifications are highly important for credibility and are often required. The most recognized designation is the Certified Financial Planner (CFP).
