      <h3>Tools & Tech Stack</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> Claims management software, estimating software (e.g., Xactimate for property, Mitchell for auto), and database software.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Digital cameras, measuring devices, and sometimes drones for inspections.</li>
      </ul>
