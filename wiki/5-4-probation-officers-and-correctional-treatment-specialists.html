            <p>Probation Officers and Correctional Treatment Specialists are key figures in the criminal justice system who work with offenders to promote rehabilitation and ensure public safety. Probation officers supervise offenders who are serving their sentences in the community (on probation or parole), while correctional treatment specialists (or case managers) primarily work within correctional facilities to develop release plans and provide counseling.</p>

                <li><strong>Supervision and Monitoring:</strong> Regularly meeting with offenders to monitor their adherence to the conditions of their probation or parole (e.g., curfews, drug tests, employment).</li>
