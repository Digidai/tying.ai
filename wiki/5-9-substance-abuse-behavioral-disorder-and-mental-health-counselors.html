            <p>Educational requirements vary by state and specific role, but a master's degree in counseling, psychology, or a related field is typically necessary for licensure. All states require counselors to be licensed to practice. Licensure generally requires a master's degree, a period of supervised clinical experience (e.g., 2,000 to 4,000 hours), and passing a state-recognized exam. Common licenses include Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) and Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC).</p>
