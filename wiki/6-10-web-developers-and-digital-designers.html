            <h2>What are Web Developers and Digital Designers?</h2>
            <p><strong>Web Developers</strong> and <strong>Digital Designers</strong> are the architects and artists of the internet. Digital Designers (including UI/UX designers) focus on the user's experience, creating the look, feel, and navigation of a website. Web Developers then take those designs and use code to build a fully functional website or web application. Their collaboration is key to creating a product that is both aesthetically pleasing and technically sound.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>What do they do?</h2>
            <p>They work together to bring a web project to life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Designers:</strong> Create visual concepts, user flows, wireframes, and prototypes. They focus on user experience (UX) to make the site easy to use and user interface (UI) to make it visually appealing.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Developers:</strong> Are typically specialized:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Front-End Developers</strong> build the visual components of a website that a user sees and interacts with, using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
                        <li><strong>Back-End Developers</strong> build and maintain the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power the front-end.</li>
                        <li><strong>Full-Stack Developers</strong> are proficient in both front-end and back-end development.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>What are their skills?</h2>
            <p>While their skills overlap in their shared goal of creating a great web experience, their core competencies are distinct:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Designers:</strong> Creativity, proficiency with design software (like Figma or Adobe XD), understanding of user-centered design principles, and visual communication skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Developers:</strong> Proficiency in coding languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end; Python, Java, Node.js for back-end), logical thinking, problem-solving, and attention to detail.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How to become one?</h2>
            <p>Paths into these fields are varied. For Digital Designers, a degree in graphic design or a related field is common, but a strong portfolio showcasing design projects and understanding of UX/UI principles is paramount. For Web Developers, a computer science degree is a traditional route, but many successful developers are self-taught or graduates of coding bootcamps. A strong portfolio of live websites or web applications is essential for developers as well. Both fields require continuous learning to keep up with evolving design trends and web technologies.</p>
