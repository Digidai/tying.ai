            <h2>What are Database Administrators and Architects?</h2>
            <p>Database Administrators (DBAs) and Architects are the guardians of an organization's data. They design, implement, maintain, and secure the databases that store vast amounts of critical information. A <strong>Database Architect</strong> designs the database from the ground up, creating the blueprint for how data will be stored and accessed. A <strong>Database Administrator</strong> is then responsible for the day-to-day management, performance, and security of that database.</p>
