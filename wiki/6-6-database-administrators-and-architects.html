        <h1>Database Administrators and Architects</h1>
        <p>Database administrators (DBAs) and architects are IT professionals responsible for the design, implementation, maintenance, and security of an organization's databases. They ensure that data is stored efficiently, is readily accessible to users, and is protected from unauthorized access or corruption. Their work is critical for any organization that relies on data for its operations.</p>

        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>While closely related, database administrators and architects have distinct primary responsibilities:</p>
        <h3>Database Administrators (DBAs)</h3>
