            <h2>What are Software Developers, QA Analysts, and Testers?</h2>
            <p>These three roles are fundamental to the creation of any software application. 
            <strong>Software Developers</strong> are the creative minds who design and build the software. 
            <strong>Quality Assurance (QA) Analysts</strong> focus on the development process, ensuring it adheres to standards to prevent defects. 
            <strong>Software Testers</strong> then examine the finished product to identify any bugs or issues before it reaches the user. While their functions are distinct, they work together in a continuous cycle of development and feedback.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>What do they do?</h2>
            <p>They work as a team to guide a project from concept to completion:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Software Developers:</strong> Design the architecture of the software, write the code, and often work with other IT professionals to deploy it.</li>
                <li><strong>QA Analysts:</strong> Define and implement quality standards, review development processes, and analyze test results to identify areas for process improvement. They focus on preventing defects.</li>
                <li><strong>Testers:</strong> Create and execute test plans and test cases, both manually and using automated tools, to find defects in the software. They report bugs to developers for fixing.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>What are their skills?</h2>
            <p>Each role requires a specific skill set, but all benefit from strong analytical and communication skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Developers:</strong> Proficiency in programming languages, creativity, and strong problem-solving skills to build functional and innovative software.</li>
                <li><strong>QA Analysts:</strong> A methodical and process-oriented mindset, strong analytical skills to understand development workflows, and communication skills to advocate for quality standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Testers:</strong> Meticulous attention to detail, a curious and investigative mindset to uncover hidden bugs, and the ability to write clear and concise bug reports.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How to become one?</h2>
            <p>A bachelor's degree in computer science is the most common path for software developers. For QA analysts and testers, a degree is common but not always required; experience and certifications can be very important. For example, certifications like the ISTQB Certified Tester are widely recognized in the testing field. All three roles require continuous learning to keep up with new programming languages, development methodologies (like Agile and DevOps), and testing tools.</p>
