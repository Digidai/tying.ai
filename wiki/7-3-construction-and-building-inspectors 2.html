            <h2>What is a Construction and Building Inspector?</h2>

            <h2>What do they do?</h2>
            <p>Inspectors review work at various stages of a project, from the foundation to the final structure. Their duties include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plan Review:</strong> Reviewing building plans and permits to ensure they comply with local and national building codes before construction begins.</li>
                <li><strong>Site Inspections:</strong> Visiting construction sites to conduct inspections at different phases of a project (e.g., foundation, framing, plumbing, electrical).</li>

                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Keeping detailed records of inspections, including any violations found and the actions taken.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Approval:</strong> Conducting a final inspection to certify that a project is complete and compliant, and issuing certificates of occupancy.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>What are their skills?</h2>
            <p>Inspectors must be knowledgeable, detail-oriented, and assertive. Key skills for this role include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Knowledge of Construction:</strong> A thorough understanding of construction methods, materials, and building codes. Many inspectors have previous experience in a construction trade.</li>
                <li><strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> The ability to spot code violations or potential safety hazards that others might miss.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication Skills:</strong> The ability to clearly explain code requirements and violations to contractors, property owners, and the public.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> A strong commitment to enforcing codes fairly and impartially to ensure public safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> The ability to interpret complex code and apply it to real-world construction situations.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How to become one?</h2>
            <p>Most building inspectors have a high school diploma and extensive experience in one or more construction trades (e.g., carpentry, plumbing, electrical work). This hands-on experience provides the necessary knowledge of construction practices. Many states and local jurisdictions have certification requirements, which may involve passing an exam on building codes. The International Code Council (ICC) offers a range of certifications that are widely recognized in the field.</p>
